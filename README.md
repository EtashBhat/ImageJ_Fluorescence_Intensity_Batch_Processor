# ImageJ_Fluorescence_Intensity_Batch_Processor
This MATLAB script, coupled with an ImageJ macro, automates fluorescence intensity analysis of microscopy images. It splits channels, processes Z-stacks, and calculates mean intensity, organizing results into an Excel file. This tool streamlines batch processing, making it ideal for large datasets in biological research.
